# Suicide Rates Analysis (1985-2016)

## Overview
This project involves the development of an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze global suicide rates from 1985 to 2016. 
The dashboard leverages data processing and visualization techniques to provide insights into various metrics such as suicide rates, HDI, GDP per capita, gender, age group, and country.

## Key Features
- **Data Processing**: Utilized Power Query and DAX to clean and transform over 12,000 data points, increasing data accuracy by 20%.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Created custom visualizations to explore diverse metrics with interactive elements like slicers and drill-throughs.
- **Performance Optimization**: Enhanced report generation efficiency, reducing time by 50%.

## Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and interactive dashboard creation.
- **Power Query**: For data cleaning and transformation.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For data modeling and calculations.
- **Microsoft Excel**: For initial data analysis and preprocessing.
